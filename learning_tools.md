* [Abusing Terraform to Upload Static Websites to S3](https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/abusing-terraform-to-upload-static-websites-to-s3): S3 has been a great option for hosting static websites for a long time, but it's still a pain to set up by hand. You need to traverse dozens of pages in the AWS Console to create and manage users, buckets, certificates, a CDN, and about a hundred different configuration options. If you do this repeatedly, it gets old fast. We can automate the process with Terraform, a well-known "infrastructure as code" tool, which lets us declare resources (e.g. servers, storage buckets, users, policies, DNS records) and let Terraform figure out how to build and connect them.
